# Tranfer learning and visualization (Pytorch)
This source code is using deep convolution neural networks to learn two classes of ants and bees based on ResNet architecture.
Also it has a a section for importing a new image and classifying it. In final section, visualization technique is used in order to shows the output of fourth layer of ResNet as image. The output image from the fourth layer is shown in following. The  output of fourth layer is 256 channels of 14x14 matrices. In order to show 256 channels as image, I have splitted every three channels into one image and shows them as follow.
