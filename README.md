# Tranfer learning and visualization (Pytorch)
Don't pay attention to this repository please. It's an exercise for me while I was learning pytorch.

This source code is using deep convolution neural networks to learn two classes of ants and bees based on ResNet architecture.
Also it has a a section for importing a new image and classifying it. In final section, visualization technique is used in order to shows the output of an intermediate layer of ResNet as image. The output image from the intermediate layer is shown in following. The  output is 256 channels of 14x14 matrices (256 X 14 X 14). In order to show 256 channels as image, the channels are splitted so that every three-channel is considered as an image. some of them are shown as follow.
